Linux OpenHAL 20072703
======================
/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\
 * This is a port of the ar5k hal for atheros device drivers that is         *
 * source-compatible with the Madwifi driver for linux.			     *
 *									     *
 * Code ported, modified for combatibility and some bugs were fixed by 	     *
 * Nick "Mick Flemm" Kossifidis (Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network)	     *
 * <mickflemm'at'gmail.com> and Pavel Roskin so ar5k can work propertly      *
 * on Linux.								     *
 *									     *
 * Currently only the 5212 code has been tested due to lack of hardware.     *
 *									     *
 * Some code from John Bicket's port (roofnet project) was taken, you can    *
 * can find his OpenHAL here -> http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~jbicket/openhal/  *

DEVELOPMENT
===========

We are basing our openhal on OpenBSD's ar5k. Because of this and since the GPL does not
allow us to commit changes on the GPL version back to the BSD version please sumbit your
non-linux enhancements to the HAL to "Reyk Floeter" <reyk@openbsd.org> and CC madwifi-devel.


About AR5K
=================
ar5k is a free replacement of the binary-only HAL used by some drivers
for Atheros chipsets. While using a different ABI, it tries to be
source-compatible with the original (non-free) HAL interface.

It is maintained by Reyk Floeter and many others. You can find more 
infos at http://team.vantronix.net/ar5k/ or inside ar5k's source.

About channels and regulatory domains
=====================================

Regulatory domain restrictions are enabled by default to follow ETSI and FCC standards.
If you want to be legal you shouldn't disable regdomains, althow if you want to
experiment etc there are 2 ways you can override regdomains:

a) Change SUPERCHANNEL to 1 (opt_ah.h)
b) Change your card's regulatory domain (EEPROM) to 0x00

WARNING: Whatever you do with your hardware is YOUR resposibility, don't blame the developers
if you get caught using your hardware outside legal ranges etc, you 've been warned...

The goal of this project is to create an open-source free alternative to binary HAL from Atheros, 
NOT to allow more channels/frequencies etc.


About AWMN
==========
Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network is a community radio network based in Athens, Greece. 
Its members are node owners, comprising the Athens metropolitan area network, which at the
moment has roughly 750 active nodes, using 802.11b and 802.11a wireless technology for interconnection.

Its aims include:

    * The development and use of community wireless network throughout the greater Athens area.
    * The development of wireless technology and its implementation.
    * Making the public aware of wireless networks and their use.
    * Educating it's members and the public on the use and benefits of wireless networks.

Building 
========
To build OpenHAL with MadWiFi, place the OpenHAL source directory in the
MadWiFi directory. Edit Makefile.inc and set the following:

HAL=${DEPTH}/<OpenHAL directory>
ATH_HAL=${DEPTH}/<OpenHAL directory>

After that, go to the top directory and build like you normally would. 

WARNING: Don't delete the empty files included (ah_desc.h etc)

Note: Currenty works for MadWiFi-old

Use
=====
You 'll have to set everything propertly for things to work
e.g. you 'll first need to set the mode (a/b/g) using 

iwpriv mode X

Then if you want to use it as an AP you'll have to set channel

iwconfig athX channel x

Txpower currently seems to be buggy, in measurements I did it seems that
tx power differs from -56 to -41 dbm, setting txpower does change txpower
but not in a normal way -needs revision.


TODO
====
* Lot's of tests and fixes.
* Make it combatible with newer versions of MadWiFi (after the merge).
* Test 5210/5211 code.
