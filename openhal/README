Linux OpenHAL 20070108
======================
/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\
 * This is a port/fork of the ar5k hal for atheros device drivers that is    *
 * source-compatible with the Madwifi driver for linux.			     *
 *									     *
 * Code ported, modified for combatibility and some bugs were fixed by 	     *
 * Nick "Mick Flemm" Kossifidis (Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network)	     *
 * <mickflemm'at'gmail.com> and Pavel Roskin so ar5k can work propertly      *
 * on Linux.								     *
 *									     *
 * Currently 5210 code has not been tested due to lack of hardware.          *
 *									     *
 * Some code from John Bicket's port (roofnet project) was used, you can     *
 * can find his OpenHAL here -> http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~jbicket/openhal/  *

DEVELOPMENT
===========

We are basing our openhal on OpenBSD's ar5k. Because of this and since the GPL does not
allow us to commit changes on the GPL version back to the BSD version please sumbit your
non-linux enhancements to the HAL to "Reyk Floeter" <reyk@openbsd.org> and CC madwifi-devel.


About AR5K
=================
ar5k is a free replacement of the binary-only HAL used by some drivers
for Atheros chipsets. While using a different ABI, it tries to be
source-compatible with the original (non-free) HAL interface.

It is maintained by Reyk Floeter and many others. You can find more 
infos at http://team.vantronix.net/ar5k/ or inside ar5k's source.

About channels and regulatory domains
=====================================

Regulatory domain restrictions are enabled by default to follow ETSI and FCC standards.
If you want to be legal you shouldn't disable regdomains, althow if you want to
experiment etc there are 2 ways you can override regdomains:

a) Change CHAN_DEBUG to 1 (opt_ah.h)
b) Change your card's regulatory domain (EEPROM) to 0x00

WARNING: Whatever you do with your hardware is YOUR resposibility, don't blame the developers
if you get caught using your hardware outside legal ranges etc, you 've been warned...

The goal of this project is to create an open-source free alternative to binary HAL from Atheros, 
NOT to allow more channels/frequencies etc.


About AWMN
==========
Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network is a community radio network based in Athens, Greece. 
Its members are node owners, comprising the Athens metropolitan area network, which at the
moment has roughly 750 active nodes, using 802.11b and 802.11a wireless technology for interconnection.

Its aims include:

    * The development and use of community wireless network throughout the greater Athens area.
    * The development of wireless technology and its implementation.
    * Making the public aware of wireless networks and their use.
    * Educating it's members and the public on the use and benefits of wireless networks.

Use
=====
You 'll have to set everything propertly for things to work
e.g. you 'll first need to set the mode (a/b/g) using 

iwpriv mode X

Then if you want to use it as an AP you'll have to set channel

iwconfig athX channel x

Txpower currently seems to be buggy, in measurements I did it seems that
tx power differs from -56 to -41 dbm, setting txpower does change txpower
but not in a normal way -needs revision.


TODO
====
* Lot's of tests and fixes.
* Fix tx power setting.
* Test 5210 code.


What works
==========
Tested combinations:
AR5213 + RF5111 (Wistron CM6)
AR5213 + RF5112a (Wistron CM9)
AR5211 + RF5111 (Toshiba/Askey)
RF5413 (don't remember vendor but it was a mini-pci one)

They all seem to work fine except 5211 which has trouble working as an AP
(probably during faulty tx power setting). Also 5413 had poor signal quality
in comparison to binary HAL. We also got reports of 5424 non-working (droping
packets etc) at all.

Please we need your feedback !
